		<h3>Overview on key research areas at the Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore</h3>
		<p>In this presentation, we will give an overview of the National University of Singapore (NUS)â€™s vision and mission: NUS strives to be a leading global university shaping the future, characterised by world-class education and scholarship, and distinguished by our thought leadership and connections in Asia. We will then zoom into the Faculty of Science (FoS), which has embarked on a quest to pursue world-class research, to achieve multiple peaks of excellence across diverse fields: among them, FoS has established leading centres such as The Centre for Quantum Technologies, The Institute for Functional Intelligent Materials (I-FIM), the Centre on Sustainable Urban Farming (SUrF) and the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions (CNCS), to name a few. The common goal is to advance science through cutting-edge technologies and create solutions for challenging issues.
