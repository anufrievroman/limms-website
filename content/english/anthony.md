## Anthony Genot

<p>1982 - 2025</p>

</div>

A former student of École Polytechnique and a doctorate holder from the University of Oxford, Anthony joined the LIMMS laboratory (CNRS/University of Tokyo) in 2011 as a postdoctoral researcher in the team of Yannick Rondelez and Professor Fujii. After a period at LAAS in 2013, he was recruited as a CNRS research scientist, returning to LIMMS, this time as scientific lead.

His research, focused on DNA chemistry, developed at a rapid pace, driven by a deeply innovative ambition. A key contributor to the PEPR MoleculArXiv program, he combined scientific rigor with technological imagination, opening new horizons in the manipulation and programming of matter at the molecular scale.

The year 2024 marked a turning point: at 42, Anthony received the CNRS Bronze Medal, was promoted to Research Director, and was appointed coordinator of one of the twelve flagship (RI)² projects of the CNRS. With this momentum, he confirmed a rare quality: that of an architect of national synergies, capable of connecting disciplines, teams, and ideas to bring bold visions to life.

In France as in Japan, many researchers who had the privilege of working with him now feel the loss of a guiding light. He embodied a form of active excellence, equally at ease leading a team that was like a second family to him, as he was in pursuing the grand ambitions of future science.

Anthony Genot exemplified with rare clarity the ideal of a CNRS researcher: a brilliant and free intellect, a mind in perpetual motion, driven by insatiable curiosity and a deep sense of humanity — qualities that are the strength and uniqueness of our institution.
