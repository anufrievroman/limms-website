### Arriving and leaving Japan

When you have just arrived to Japan or changing your address, you need to go to your new city hall (with the paper from previous city hall if you change address) and declare that you are moving in. This should be done in 14 days. When you are leaving Japan, you need to go to your city hall again and declare that you are leaving. Otherwise, they may ask you to pay taxes etc.

To update your residence card, you need to go to [Tokyo Immigration Office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iegZykYYm3Bt9AbN8) with documents provided by LIMMS office. Inform LIMMS office at least 2 months before the expiration date.


### Healthcare in Japan

When you register in your city hall, you'll also sign up for Japanese health insurance (which is mandatory to have in Japan), and eventually receive the insurance card. With this card you can go to any clinic and you'll pay only a small portion of a full price. Usually, you need to visit a general doctor first, and then the doctor will send you to a specialist.

In the University of Tokyo, you have access to [campus medical center at Komaba 1](https://www.hc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), which is [located here](https://www.hc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/qa-others/contact/#komaba). There, you can always consult a general (English speaking) doctor who can write prescriptions or direct you to a specialized doctor. There are a few specialized doctors too. However, here are few more useful options:

- [English-speaking clinic for general issues](https://tmsc.jp)
- [English-speaking clinic for sport trauma](http://www.yamateclinic.jp)
- [English-speaking dentist](https://www.miharadentalclinic.com)
- [A service](https://japanhealthinfo.com) that finds a doctor for your special case and book an appointment. They'll charge a few thousand yen, but it's convenient.


### Bank, money transfer, mobile, internet

- If you don't speak Japanese, here is an English-speaking bank: https://www.smbctb.co.jp (not to be confused with regular SMBC bank).
- If you don't have a Japanese credit card, and you don't speak Japanese, you can get a sim card and wifi here: https://www.sakuramobile.jp, although the price is not the cheapest. If you don't mind using eSIM, here are better options: https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/esim-japan-travel
- To transfer money from abroad to Japanese bank, the cheapest way seems to be through [Wise](https://wise.com). You first transfer money into your European Wise account, convert into yen, and send to Japanese bank.
